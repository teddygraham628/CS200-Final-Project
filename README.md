Our project is based on the Napster fad/controversy that happened in 1999-2001. Napster was a free peer-to-peer file sharing application that allowed users to share files with each other and was primarily used for music. This was extremely controversial because it allowed people to own and play music without paying the artists who made the music, essentially bypassing the marketplace. Napster stopped operating in 2001 and filed for bankruptcy in 2002, but they re-emerged in 2008 when they merged with Rhapsody. Now they are a full-fledged streaming service that you can pay for.
The game follows the story of a person who wants to get music but doesn't have enough money to pay for it. We make mention to the risk of downloading unrecognized files, and we mention the band Metallica because they sued Napster for allowing users to give out their music for free.
